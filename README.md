## Using it

`/r 1d8 + 4d6` - Roll one octahedron and four hexahedrons.

`/r 1d20+5 // Grog attacks` - Roll dice with a comment. (Here's a regular expression that separates the comment from the roll: https://www.debuggex.com/r/BKudF3rW8MaRsinc).

`/r 2d6>=5` - Roll two hexahedrons and take only the ones that turned greater or equal to five (aka difficulty check).

`/r 4d6=5` - So can this guy roll five?

`/r (2+2)^2` - Do math.

`/r 4d6^2` - Do math with dice.
